# Task Description

The task was to implement a rating system and display the rating for each comic. The rating should be based on the average score users can give comics from 1 to 5. The rating should be updated in real-time on any modern framework.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. Creating a Rating

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/api/ratings/`
- **Parameters**:
 - `comic_id` - comic identifier
 - `user_id` - user identifier
 - `value` - rating from 1 to 5
- **Description**: When creating a rating, the comic's average rating is updated, and the rating is saved. To send a request, the user must be logged in. The service implements the basic authentication method.

### 2. Getting the Average Comic Rating

- **Method**: `GET`
- **URL**: `/api/comics/<comic_id>/rating/`
- **Description**: Returns the average rating of the comic. There are no user requirements for this endpoint. Manual Redis caching has also been added as a query optimization to the database.

## User Registration

User registration is provided by Django through the admin panel (you must first create a superuser) by running the command:

```bash
docker ps # get all running containers
# copy the id or container name
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash # command to run the shell inside the Django container (container name: rating)
./manage.py createsuperuser # register superuser
